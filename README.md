# nft-indexer-pro
Advanced NFT Indexer built with React + Vite + Chakra UI + Alchemy SDK — fetches and displays all NFTs owned by any wallet address. Includes wallet integration, ENS support, loading indicators, error handling, custom UI styling, and a manual “no-SDK” NFT indexer mode implemented using ethers.js and on-chain event parsing.
